# Theme system

**Branch:** lyndon/theme-system
**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Branch Preview:** <!-- replace me -->

## Context

Shape knowledge is scattered across the codebase: `CanvasNode.shape: "circle" | "rect"` is a
rigid enum with 12+ dispatch points across rendering, edge clipping, surface geometry, and the
IDE adapter. The theme system only resolves style (colors/stroke) — shape is determined before
the theme sees the node. This makes it impossible to swap visual styles or introduce new shapes
without touching multiple files.

**Continues from:** [`PLANS/2026-05-18-lyndon-extract-layout.md`](2026-05-18-lyndon-extract-layout.md)
— Phase 8 (design decisions D1–D9) was designed during the layout extraction but deferred as
out of scope for that branch. This branch implements Phase 8.

## Goal

Replace the shape enum with an opaque `NodeGeometry` type, make the theme responsible for
resolving geometry (not just style), introduce visual roles, and create the CLASSIC theme that
reproduces current visual behavior exactly.

### Not in scope (deferred from extract-layout Phase 8)

- **ForceNode shape representation (D9)** — layout package unchanged. Future: extensible
  tagged-record approach (see Haskell Diagrams, Inigo Quilez references in extract-layout plan).
- **New shape types** (diamond, hexagon, etc.) — the infrastructure enables them but we don't
  add any yet.
- **Constructive SDF geometry** — union, intersection, subtraction combinators. Deferred.
- **WebGL rendering target** — natural follow-on from SDF-based shapes. Deferred.
- **Extension concept** — bundles of themes + primitives + layout hints. Deferred.

## Approach

### Phase A — `NodeGeometry` type and implementations

- [x] A.1 Create `packages/canvas/geometry/node-geometry.ts`:
  - `NodeGeometry` interface with methods:
    - `renderBody(w, h, style) → RenderPrimitive[]` — produce shape primitives relative to
      node center
    - `surfacePoint(cx, cy, w, h, tx, ty, gap) → Point` — boundary point toward target
    - `arcClip(arcC, r, center, w, h, gap, sweep, other) → Point` — arc-circle clipping
    - `sdf(w, h) → (px, py) → number` — signed distance field for this geometry (D1: SDF
      is the only external query mechanism for the opaque shape)
    - `portPositions(ports, w, h, labelH) → CanvasPort[]` — shape-specific port placement
    - `strokeDash(dashed: boolean) → string | undefined` — shape-specific dash pattern
  - `CIRCLE_GEOMETRY: NodeGeometry` singleton — wraps current circle logic from renderNode
    (line 34-45), surfacePoint (line 30-32), arcClipPoint
  - `RECT_GEOMETRY: NodeGeometry` singleton — wraps current rect logic from renderNode
    (line 19-33), surfacePoint (line 35-41), arcClipRect
  - `resolveGeometry(node) → NodeGeometry` — bridge function: `geometry ?? shape fallback`
- [x] A.2 Create `packages/canvas/geometry/node-geometry_test.ts` — verify implementations
  match existing inline behavior exactly (same inputs → same outputs)
- [x] A.3 Export from `packages/canvas/mod.ts`
- [x] A.4 `deno check` passes

#### Key files:
- New: `packages/canvas/geometry/node-geometry.ts`
- New: `packages/canvas/geometry/node-geometry_test.ts`
- Modify: `packages/canvas/mod.ts`

### Phase B — Rewire canvas dispatch points to use `NodeGeometry`

- [x] B.1 Add `geometry?: NodeGeometry` to `CanvasNode` (alongside existing `shape`)
- [x] B.2 Rewire `renderNode` (render/node.ts:19-46) — replace if/else with
  `resolveGeometry(node).renderBody(...)`. Style still comes from `theme.node(node)`.
- [x] B.3 Rewire `surfacePoint` (geometry/surface.ts:30-41) — replace shape dispatch with
  `resolveGeometry(from).surfacePoint(...)`
- [x] B.4 Rewire `computeEdgePath` (render/edge.ts:86-98) — replace 4 shape checks with
  `resolveGeometry(pa).arcClip(...)` and `resolveGeometry(pb).arcClip(...)`
- [x] B.5 Tests pass without updating helpers — resolveGeometry falls back to shape field.
  573 tests green.
- [x] B.6 All tests pass, visual output byte-identical

#### Key files:
- Modify: `packages/canvas/scene/types.ts` — add `geometry?` field
- Modify: `packages/canvas/render/node.ts` — replace shape dispatch
- Modify: `packages/canvas/geometry/surface.ts` — replace shape dispatch
- Modify: `packages/canvas/render/edge.ts` — replace 4 shape dispatches
- Modify: `packages/canvas/render/scene_test.ts` — update test helpers
- Modify: `packages/canvas/geometry/surface_test.ts` — update test helpers

### Phase C — Extend `CanvasTheme` with geometry resolution

- [x] C.1 Add optional `resolveNode` to `CanvasTheme<S>`:
  `resolveNode?: (node: CanvasNode<S>) => { geometry: NodeGeometry; style: NodeStyle }`
  When present, takes precedence over the separate `node` resolver.
- [x] C.2 Add optional `constants` to `CanvasTheme<S>`:
  `constants?: { groupPadding: number; labelH: number; leafRadius: number }`
- [x] C.3 Update `renderNode` — if `theme.resolveNode` exists, use it for both geometry and
  style; otherwise fall back to `theme.node(node)` + `resolveGeometry(node)`
- [x] C.4 `marlinTheme` unchanged — continues using `node` resolver. Works via fallback.
- [x] C.5 Tests pass (102 canvas tests)

#### Key files:
- Modify: `packages/canvas/style/types.ts` — add `resolveNode?`, `constants?`
- Modify: `packages/canvas/render/node.ts` — theme.resolveNode support
- Modify: `packages/canvas/mod.ts` — export new types if any

### Phase D — Style property schema

Define the shared vocabulary for style properties used by both themes and per-element
overrides. Same data format in both contexts — themes define defaults per role, elements
override specific properties.

- [x] D.1 Define `NodeStyleProps` in `packages/canvas/style/types.ts` — the declarative
  property bag shared by themes and element overrides:
  ```
  interface NodeStyleProps {
    geometry?: "circle" | "rect";    // resolved to NodeGeometry by theme
    fill?: string;
    stroke?: string;
    strokeWidth?: number;
    labelFill?: string;
    labelFont?: string;
    labelSize?: number;
    opacity?: number;
    groupPadding?: number;           // container extent rule
    labelH?: number;                 // container label strip height
  }
  ```
  All fields optional — overrides merge sparsely over theme defaults.
- [x] D.2 Export from `packages/canvas/mod.ts`
- [x] D.3 Tests pass

#### Key files:
- Modify: `packages/canvas/style/types.ts` — add `NodeStyleProps`
- Modify: `packages/canvas/mod.ts`

### Phase E — Visual roles and CLASSIC theme

Roles and the CLASSIC theme live in `src/` (application code, not a package). The canvas
package provides the generic mechanism; roles are marlinspike-specific semantics.

- [x] E.1 Add `role` field to `MarlinNodeState` in `src/ui/lib/canvas-adapter.ts`:
  `role: "leaf" | "container" | "collapsed-subgraph" | "ref" | "leaf-rect"`
  Derived from: `kind`, expansion state, constraint overrides.
- [x] E.2 Add `styleOverrides?: NodeStyleProps` to `MarlinNodeState` — per-element style
  overrides from constraints, merged over theme defaults during resolution.
- [x] E.3 Create `src/ui/lib/classic-theme.ts` — the CLASSIC theme implementing
  `CanvasTheme<MarlinNodeState>` with `resolveNode` that:
  1. Maps role to default `NodeStyleProps` (the theme definition)
  2. Merges `node.state.styleOverrides` over the defaults (sparse merge)
  3. Resolves `geometry` string to `NodeGeometry` (CIRCLE/RECT)
  4. Returns `{ geometry, style }`
  Also includes `resolveEdgeStyle`, `resolvePortStyle`, `resolveDecorations`,
  and `constants: { groupPadding: 32, labelH: 22, leafRadius: 26 }`.
- [x] E.4 Role computation in `emitLevel()` — replace shape determination
  (canvas-adapter.ts:241-243) with role derivation:
  ```
  isExpanded → "container"
  isRef → "ref"
  isComposite && hasChildren → "collapsed-subgraph"
  else → "leaf"
  ```
  Set `geometry` on CanvasNode based on role + overrides.
- [x] E.5 Replace `marlinIdeTheme` in canvas-adapter.ts with import of CLASSIC theme
- [x] E.6 Update `canvas.tsx` — read `GROUP_PADDING` and `LABEL_H` from
  `theme.constants` instead of hardcoded constants
- [x] E.7 Tests pass (573 tests), visual behavior identical

#### Key files:
- New: `src/ui/lib/classic-theme.ts`
- Modify: `src/ui/lib/canvas-adapter.ts` — add role + styleOverrides to state, remove
  style resolvers, use CLASSIC theme
- Modify: `src/ui/components/canvas.tsx` — theme constants for GROUP_PADDING/LABEL_H

### Phase F — Migrate constraints to style overrides

Eliminate `data.rendering.shape`. Constraints use the same `NodeStyleProps` format as
themes, applied as a top-level `style` field on the `Constraint` type.

- [x] F.1 Add optional `style?: NodeStyleProps` to `Constraint` interface in
  `src/ui/workspace.ts` (top-level, not nested in `data`)
- [x] F.2 Migrate `WORKSPACE_CONSTRAINT`: remove `data: { rendering: { shape: "rect" } }`,
  add `style: { geometry: "rect" }` at top level
- [x] F.3 Migrate `PROFILE_CONSTRAINT`: same pattern
- [x] F.4 Update `canvas.tsx` constraint processing: read from `constraint.style`,
  build `styleOverridesMap: Map<string, NodeStyleProps>`, derive `shapeMap` from it
  for layout backwards compat, pass `styleOverrides` to buildCanvasScene.
- [x] F.5 Old `data.rendering.shape` code path removed — shapeMap now derived from
  styleOverridesMap. (shapeMap itself kept for layout system ForceNode.shape compat,
  removed in Phase G.)
- [x] F.6 Update DESIGN.md reference to `data.rendering.shape`
- [x] F.7 Tests pass (573 tests), constraint-driven rect nodes still render correctly

#### Key files:
- Modify: `src/ui/workspace.ts` — add `style?` to Constraint
- Modify: `src/graph/builtin_constraints.ts` — migrate WORKSPACE + PROFILE constraints
- Modify: `src/ui/components/canvas.tsx` — new constraint→style processing
- Modify: `src/ui/lib/canvas-adapter.ts` — receive styleOverrides from canvas.tsx
- Modify: `DESIGN.md` — update constraint docs

### Phase G — Remove deprecated `shape` field

- [x] G.1 Make `shape` optional on `CanvasNode` with `@deprecated` JSDoc
- [x] G.2 Canvas-adapter still sets both `shape` and `geometry` — shape kept for story
  backwards compat. Geometry is the primary field.
- [x] G.3 `resolveGeometry` already handles `geometry ?? shape ?? CIRCLE` — no change needed
- [x] G.4 Update all canvas-package test helpers to use `geometry` only (scene_test,
  surface_test, hit-test_test, pointer_test, marlin_theme_test)
- [x] G.5 Update story files to use `geometry` instead of `shape` (completed in Phase J)
- [x] G.6 `NO_COLOR=1 deno task ci` — 573 tests green
- [x] G.7 Decision: keep `shape` as optional with `@deprecated`. resolveGeometry bridge
  handles fallback. Stories still use shape — migrated in Phase J.

#### Key files:
- Modify: `packages/canvas/scene/types.ts` — shape optional or removed
- Modify: `packages/canvas/geometry/node-geometry.ts` — update resolveGeometry
- Modify: `packages/canvas/render/scene_test.ts` — geometry-only helpers
- Modify: various story files

### Phase H — Extract theme package

Extract generic theme machinery into `packages/theme/` while keeping semantic role
definitions in marlinspike application code. Architecture:

- **`packages/theme/`** — generic theme infrastructure:
  - `ThemeDefinition` — interface for theme machinery (resolve, constants, etc.)
  - `resolveProps(roleDefs, role, overrides) → NodeStyleProps` — sparse merge
  - `resolveGeometryFromProps(props) → NodeGeometry` — geometry string → singleton
  - Re-export `NodeStyleProps`, `ThemeConstants` from canvas package
- **Structural intersection over parameterised generics** — `ThemeDefinition` carries
  mechanism (what a theme *does*); `MarlinSemanticIdentifiers` carries the domain contract
  (what roles a marlinspike theme *must provide*). A valid marlinspike theme is
  `ThemeDefinition & MarlinSemanticIdentifiers`. This separates concerns cleanly:
  - The theme package doesn't know about marlinspike's roles — just provides mechanism
  - Open extension: plugins add `& ExtensionIdentifiers` without touching ThemeDefinition
  - Multi-app composition: `ThemeDefinition & AppA & AppB` — additive, preserves provenance
  - Follows TS idiom: generics suit containers (`Array<T>`), intersections suit
    "satisfies multiple contracts"
- **Geometry resolution** — `NodeStyleProps.geometry` is a string identifier. The theme
  package resolves strings to `NodeGeometry` singletons via a registry.
- **Semantic identifiers** — marlinspike defines `MarlinSemanticIdentifiers` mandating
  required role keys (`"leaf"`, `"container"`, `"collapsed-subgraph"`, `"ref"`,
  `"leaf-rect"`) each mapping to `NodeStyleProps`. The theme package's resolve function
  takes a string key and a props map — type safety comes from the app-side interface
  constraining which strings are valid.
- **CLASSIC theme** becomes: `ThemeDefinition & MarlinSemanticIdentifiers` with base
  role→props + interaction-dependent style logic as TS functions (selection/hover/error
  states are computed, not declarative — they stay in the theme function).

Steps:
- [x] H.1 Create `packages/theme/` with `deno.json`, `mod.ts`
- [x] H.2 Define `ThemeDefinition` — theme machinery interface
- [x] H.3 Define `MarlinSemanticIdentifiers` in `src/` — required role→props contract
- [x] H.4 Implement `resolveProps(roleDefs, role, overrides)` — merge logic
- [x] H.5 Implement geometry string→singleton resolution
- [x] H.6 Move CLASSIC theme to `ThemeDefinition & MarlinSemanticIdentifiers`
- [x] H.7 Import theme package from `src/ui/lib/classic-theme.ts`
- [x] H.8 Tests pass (582 tests)

#### Key files:
- New: `packages/theme/deno.json`
- New: `packages/theme/mod.ts` — re-exports ThemeDefinition, resolveProps, resolveGeometryFromProps
- New: `packages/theme/types.ts` — ThemeDefinition, RoleDefs interfaces
- New: `packages/theme/resolve.ts` — resolveProps, resolveGeometryFromProps
- New: `packages/theme/resolve_test.ts` — 8 tests for resolve utilities
- New: `src/ui/lib/marlin-theme-contract.ts` — MarlinSemanticIdentifiers
- Modify: `src/ui/lib/classic-theme.ts` — use theme package, export classicDefinition
- Modify: `deno.json` — workspace member, import map, CI check
- Modify: `deno.client.json` — import map

### Phase H design notes

**Style representation:**
- Native representation is a TypeScript interface with functions (computed properties for
  interaction-dependent styles like hover/selection/error state).
- Base role definitions within a theme are pure data (role→NodeStyleProps maps).
- Bundled themes (CLASSIC) are `.ts` files that directly construct the interface.
- The native TS interface is the source of truth and satisfies all immediate needs.

**JSON serialization (deferred):**
- A `fromJSON()` helper could validate and hydrate JSON into the native interface.
- JSON representation would enable: documentation, authorship metadata, serialization into
  the graph for meta-style capabilities, safety via validation.
- Deferred because the native TS interface covers our current use cases. Worth revisiting
  when meta-style capabilities (styles stored in the graph) become relevant.

**Bidirectional codec (deferred, design north star):**
- Single definition yields parser + serializer + schema + TypeScript types. Like Haskell's
  [autodocodec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/autodocodec) but for the marlinspike
  ecosystem. Would eliminate the need to define independent schema and parser — validation
  and type definition unified.
- Recursive possibility: the codec itself could be a marlinspike graph — a graph that
  defines how to validate graphs. This connects to the broader "domain app" vision
  (see `examples/sdf-geometry-algebra/`).

**SDF geometry algebra (deferred, see `examples/sdf-geometry-algebra/`):**
- Composing SDF primitives via constructive operations (union, intersection, smooth blend)
  as a dataflow graph — the graph *is* the shape definition.
- The graph structure enables: SDF evaluation, Jacobian via reverse-mode AD (chain rule
  over the computation DAG), and GLSL shader code generation.
- Demonstrates the "domain app" pattern: domain-specific applications as graph topologies
  with constraints. Other potential domain apps: signal processing, shader graphs, circuit
  design, probabilistic programs.

### Phase I — Update DESIGN.md

- [x] I.1 Update DESIGN.md to reflect the theme system architecture
- [x] I.2 Document the theme package, role system, style property schema
- [x] I.3 Document constraint migration (style overrides instead of data.rendering.shape)

### Phase J — Theme system stories + final shape removal

- [x] J.1 Write canvas-package stories exercising theme.resolveNode
- [x] J.2 Write a story showing custom NodeGeometry (diamond — demonstrates extensibility)
- [x] J.3 Write a theme-package story showing ThemeDefinition + resolveProps
- [x] J.4 Migrate all story files from `shape` to `geometry` (completes G.5)
- [x] J.5 Remove `shape` field from `CanvasNode` entirely. Remove shape branch
  from `resolveGeometry`. Remove `shape` assignments in canvas-adapter.ts.
  (`worldPos` internal type retains shape string for role derivation — not exposed.)
- [x] J.6 CI green with shape fully removed (581 tests)

### Dependency graph

```
A (NodeGeometry type)
  → B (rewire canvas dispatch)
    → C (extend CanvasTheme)
      → D (style property schema)
        → E (roles + CLASSIC theme + rewire IDE)
          → F (migrate constraints to style overrides)
            → G (deprecate shape field)
              → H (extract theme package)
                → I (update DESIGN.md)
                → J (stories + final shape removal)
```

Each phase is independently committable. A–D are within `packages/canvas/`.
E–F are the integration steps. G deprecates shape; J removes it entirely after
stories are migrated. H is package extraction. I and J are parallel after H.

## Open Questions

1. **`decorations` resolver** — the current `resolveDecorations` in canvas-adapter.ts reads
   `node.state.isContainerBackground`, `node.state.childrenCount`, etc. This is deeply tied
   to MarlinNodeState. Should it move to the CLASSIC theme or stay in the adapter?
   Lean: move to CLASSIC theme (it's visual, not structural).

2. **`isContainerBackground` pattern** — expanded containers currently emit TWO CanvasNodes:
   a background rect and an invisible overlay. With the role system, should we instead have
   a single "container" role that renders both? Or keep the two-node pattern?
   Lean: keep two-node pattern for now — it works and the refactor scope is already large.

3. **Theme package scope** — the theme package provides generic machinery. Interaction-
   dependent style logic (hover, selection, error states) is computed rather than declarative.
   Should the theme package provide a combinator for layering interaction state over base
   role styles, or leave that entirely to consumers? Lean: leave to consumers initially,
   extract patterns if they emerge.

4. **Decouple canvas from theme (deferred refactor)** — currently `renderScene`, `renderNode`,
   and `renderEdge` take a `CanvasTheme<S>` parameter and call style resolvers internally
   during rendering. The original architectural intent was that canvas would be a pure renderer
   of pre-styled primitives: the caller resolves all styles *above* canvas (through a theme
   layer), then passes pre-resolved style properties on the scene elements themselves.

   **Current:** `renderScene(scene, theme)` — canvas calls `theme.node(node)` internally.
   **Alternative:** styles live on `CanvasNode` directly — canvas renders what it's given.

   The current approach is convenient because the theme sees the full `CanvasNode<S>` at
   resolution time (geometry, selection state, neighbours). But it creates a circular concern:
   `CanvasTheme<S>` takes `CanvasNode<S>`, coupling the theme API to the canvas element type.
   If styles were pre-resolved, themes would only need the *application's* types
   (MarlinNodeState), not canvas's.

   **Tradeoffs:**
   - Pre-resolved: cleaner layering, canvas has fewer concepts, theme doesn't need canvas types
   - Current: convenient single-call API, theme sees full context during rendering
   - Incremental migration is possible: add optional `style` field to CanvasNode, make
     renderers check it before calling theme resolvers, deprecate theme parameter

   Lean: worth doing eventually for architectural cleanliness, but not blocking. The current
   `CanvasTheme<S>` is really just a callback pattern — canvas doesn't know about theme
   *concepts*, only about calling resolver functions. The coupling is at the type level, not
   at the knowledge level.

### Resolved

- **SDF on NodeGeometry** — YES, include `sdf(w, h)` now. It's the core of D1.
- **Port positioning on NodeGeometry** — YES, `portPositions(ports, w, h, labelH)` as a
  method. Centralizes shape-specific dispatch.
- **Scope** — full (A–J). 10 phases in this branch.
- **Style schema** — YES, implement now as `NodeStyleProps`. Same property format for theme
  definitions and per-element overrides. Sparse merge: element overrides ← theme defaults.
- **Constraint migration** — YES, eliminate `data.rendering.shape`. Move to top-level
  `style: NodeStyleProps` on `Constraint`. Same vocabulary as themes.
- **Theme package extraction** — YES, in scope. Generic machinery in `packages/theme/`,
  semantic role identifiers mandated by app-specific schema. Native TS interface as source
  of truth. JSON serialization deferred — TS satisfies immediate needs.
- **Structural intersection over generics** — `ThemeDefinition & MarlinSemanticIdentifiers`
  rather than `ThemeDefinition<MarlinRoles>`. Separates mechanism from domain contract,
  supports open extension and multi-app composition, follows TS idiom for "satisfies
  multiple contracts".
